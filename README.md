# Realtime-gravity-simulation
Gravity simulation using python with real astronomical values.

*Note: Requires Python 3.10+ along with Pygame*

- Works only with extremely large masses over the course of a long period of time due to the value of G(6.67 * 10^11)
- Accurate values of planets and sun in the solar system for realtime simulation
- Classification of stars based on their mass along with color
- Semi realistic black hole simulation
